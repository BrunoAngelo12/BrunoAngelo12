### Hello! 👋

My name is Bruno and I am passionate about programming. Although I currently have no academic background, I am committed to learning and exploring the world of technology. I'm interested in finding out where to go professionally with my programming knowledge.

I am currently looking to make a career transition, migrating from a previous professional field to the world of technology. I'm looking for my first opportunity as a developer.

My programming journey started with the Bootcamp for beginner software programmers, where I immersed myself in the world of coding. Next, I explored algorithm concepts and improved my skills in basic Java, which was the language I most identified with.

My mission is to use my passion for technology to create solutions that can improve people's quality of life and make the world a better place. I believe that programming has the power to turn ideas into reality and I am committed to making a difference through software development.

I am currently focused on improving my skills by taking an advanced Java course and participating in the Bootcamp Back End Santander 2023, where I am acquiring valuable knowledge.

If you want to know more about me or have any questions, feel free to get in touch. 🚀
